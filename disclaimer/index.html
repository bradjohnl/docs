Consequently, neither CasperLabs Networks AG nor any of its affiliates assumes any responsibility that the information set out herein is final or correct and each of the foregoing disclaims, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all liability whether arising in tort, contract or otherwise in respect of this Whitepaper. Neither this Whitepaper nor anything contained herein shall form the basis of or be relied on in connection with or act as an inducement to enter into any contract or commitment whatsoever. Recipients should note that the final structuring of CSPR and the Casper blockchain is subject to ongoing technical, legal, regulatory and tax considerations and each is, therefore, subject to material changes. In particular, neither the applicability nor the non-applicability of Swiss financial market regulations on the CSPR sale has not been confirmed by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (&quot;<strong>FINMA</strong>&quot;). CasperLabs Networks AG and all its affiliates reserve the right to not assist in the completion of the software underlying CSPR and the CasperLabs blockchain, to not participate in the issuance or creation of CSPR or to change the structure of CSPR and/or the Casper blockchain for any reason, each at its sole discretion.</p><p><strong>Forward-Looking Statements</strong></p><p>This Whitepaper includes &quot;forward-looking statements&quot;, which are all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this Whitepaper. Words like &quot;believe&quot;, &quot;anticipate&quot;, &quot;expect&quot;, &quot;project&quot;, &quot;estimate&quot;, &quot;predict&quot;, &quot;intend&quot;, &quot;target&quot;, &quot;assume&quot;, &quot;may&quot;, &quot;might&quot;, &quot;could&quot;, &quot;should&quot;, &quot;will&quot; and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause the actual functionality, performance or features of the Casper blockchain and/or CSPR to be materially different from any future functionality, performance or features expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding the CasperLabs Networks AG&#x27;s and/or any of its affiliates&#x27; present and future expectations regarding the development of the Casper blockchain and the associated software.</p><p>These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Whitepaper. CasperLabs Networks AG and its affiliates expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release any updates of or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in CasperLabs Networks AG&#x27;s and/or any of its affiliates&#x27; expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.</p><p><strong>Risk Factors</strong></p><p>Furthermore, by accepting this Whitepaper, the recipient of hereof (the &quot;<strong>Recipient</strong>&quot;) acknowledges and agrees that it understands the inherent risks associated with blockchain and distributed ledger technology, tokens and cryptocurrencies in general and the CSPR in particular, including, but not limited to, those outlined hereinafter.</p><ul><li><strong>Risks associated with CasperLabs Networks AG&#x27;s experience</strong>: the Recipient is aware that CasperLabs Networks AG and its affiliates constitute a start-up group of companies. Inability of such companies to manage their affairs, including any failure to attract and retain appropriate personnel, could affect the completion and functionality of the Casper blockchain.</li><li><strong>Risks associated with CSPR relative value</strong>: the Recipient understands and accepts that a purchaser of CSPR may experience financial losses relative to other assets, including fiat currency and/or any other cryptocurrency (including any cryptocurrency used to acquire CSPR). Potential purchasers and holders of CSPR are urged to carefully review this Whitepaper and assess and understand the risk factors relating to the CSPR and the Casper blockchain before acquiring CSPR (when and if CSPR become available).</li><li><strong>Risks associated with (intellectual) property rights</strong>: the Recipient understands and accepts that, due to a lack of originality of the software and to the immaterial character of the CSPR, there may be no title of ownership in and to the intellectual property rights relating to CSPR.</li><li><strong>Risks associated with blockchain</strong>: the Recipient understands and accepts that the smart contract, the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the Casper blockchain) is still in an early development stage and unproven. The Recipient understands and accepts that there is no warranty that the process for creating the CSPR and/or the Casper blockchain will be uninterrupted or error-free and acknowledges that there is an inherent risk that the software could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of CSPR. The Recipient understands and accepts that, after launch of the Casper blockchain, the smart contract and/or underlying protocols and/or the Casper blockchain and/or any other software involved may either delay and/or not execute a contribution due to the overall contribution volume, mining attacks and/or similar events.</li><li><strong>Risk of weaknesses in the field of cryptography</strong>: the Recipient understands and accepts that cryptography is a technology that evolves relatively fast over time. At the same time, methods and tools to decrypt, access and/or manipulate data stored on a distributed ledger or blockchain are highly likely to progress in parallel and in addition, new technological developments such as quantum computers may pose as of now unpredictable risks to the CSPR and the Casper blockchain that could increase the risk of theft or loss of CSPR (if and when CSPR are created and/or issued).</li><li><strong>Regulatory risks</strong>: the Recipient understands and accepts that it is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations on, or introduce new regulations addressing, distributed ledger technology and/or blockchain technology based applications, which may be contrary to the current setup of the smart contract or the CasperLabs Networks AG project and which may, inter alia, result in substantial modifications of the smart contract and/or the CasperLabs Networks AG project, including its termination and the loss of the CSPR, if and when created and/or issued, or entitlements to receive CSPR, for the Recipient.</li><li><strong>Risks associated with abandonment / lack of success</strong>: the Recipient understands and accepts that the creation of the CSPR and the development of the Casper blockchain as well as the CasperLabs Networks AG project may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, lack of prospects (e.g. caused by competing projects) and legal, tax or regulatory considerations. The Recipient therefore understands that there is no assurance that, even if the CSPR/CasperLabs blockchain project is partially or fully developed and launched, the Recipient will receive any benefits through the CSPR held by it (if and when created and/or issued).</li><li><strong>Risks associated with a loss of private key</strong>: the Recipient understands and accepts that CSPR, if and when created and/or issued, will only be accessed by using a wallet technically compatible with CSPR and with a combination of the Recipient&#x27;s account information (address) and private key, seed or password. The Recipient understands and accepts that if its private key or password gets lost or stolen, the CSPR associated with the Recipient&#x27;s account (address) will be unrecoverable and will be permanently lost.</li><li><strong>Risks associated with wallets:</strong> the Recipient understands and accepts that CasperLabs Networks AG or any of its affiliates, employees, partners or advisors are in no way responsible for the wallet to which any CSPR are transferred. The Recipient understands and agrees that it is solely responsible for the access and security of its wallet, for any security breach of its wallet and/or with any loss of CSPR resulting from its wallet service provider, including any termination of the service by the wallet provider and/or bankruptcy of the wallet provider.</li><li><strong>Risks associated with theft/hacks</strong>: the Recipient understands and accepts that the smart contract, the website, the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the Casper blockchain), during its development and after its launch, may be exposed to attacks by hackers or other individuals that could result in an inability to launch the Casper blockchain or the theft or loss of CSPR. Any such event could also result in the loss of financial and other support of the CasperLabs Networks AG project impacting the ability to develop the CasperLabs Networks AG project and Casper blockchain.</li><li><strong>Risks associated with mining attacks</strong>: the Recipient understands and accepts that, as with other cryptocurrencies and tokens, if and when launched, the Casper blockchain is susceptible to attacks relating to validators. Any successful attack presents a risk to the smart contract, expected proper execution and sequencing of transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations.</li><li><strong>Risks associated with a lack of consensus</strong>: the Recipient understands and accepts that the network of validators will be ultimately in control of the genesis block and future blocks and that there is no warranty or assurance that the network of validators will perform their functions and reach proper consensus and allocate the CSPR to the Recipient as proposed by any terms. The Recipient further understands that a majority of the validators could agree at any point to make changes to the software and/or smart contracts and to run the new version of the software and/or smart contracts. Such a scenario could lead to the CSPR losing intrinsic value.</li><li><strong>Risks associated with liquidity of CSPR</strong>: the Recipient understands and accepts that with regard to the CSPR, if and when created and/or issued, no market liquidity may be guaranteed and that the value of CSPR relative to other assets, including fiat currency and/or any other cryptocurrency (including any cryptocurrency used to acquire CSPR) over time may experience extreme volatility or depreciate in full (including to zero) resulting in loss that will be borne exclusively by the Recipient.</li><li><strong>Risks associated with forking</strong>: the Recipient understands and accepts that hard and soft forks as well as similar events may, inter alia, lead to the creation of new or competing tokens to the CSPR, adversely affect the functionality, convertibility or transferability or result in a full or partial loss of units or reduction (including reduction to zero) of value of the Recipient&#x27;s CSPR (if and when created and/or issued).</li></ul></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/casper-network/documentation/tree/master/docs/casper/disclaimer.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2_ui" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_13-_"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer"><div class="container"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright"><div class="footer-inner-container">
