For example, the ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"AddKeys")," transform is about adding elements to a map, which is a commutative operation as well (so long as none of the keys already existed in the map, then it is more akin to a write operation). Yet, this operation can also fail due to the physical machine being out of memory, thus once again meaning the order of additions could effect the final state of the map."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"In a more powerful theory of parallel execution we could consider operations which fail. In this case we could say that transforms ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"t_1")," and ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"t_2")," commute if they are of the same addition type and the outcome of applying both to the input global state, ",(0,i.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},(0,i.kt)("em",{parentName:"strong"},"G"))," is not an error. This is a more complex rule because it requires doing some amount of computation during commutativity checking, whereas the previous theory was simple comparison. Yet, this theory might be worth pursuing because it solves the two problems we have listed here (overflow and out-of-memory), along with other problems that we presently cannot handle at all. For example, ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Minus")," could be introduced as a transform, and underflows could be handled using this refined commutativity rule. This has practical application in our system because it would mean transfers from the same source could commute if enough funds are available, whereas presently they will always be conservatively labeled as not commuting."),(0,i.kt)("div",{className:"footnotes"},(0,i.kt)("hr",{parentName:"div"}),(0,i.kt)("ol",{parentName:"div"},(0,i.kt)("li",{parentName:"ol",id:"fn-1"},"There is a special case of constructing reduced traces which is worth calling out explicitly.
